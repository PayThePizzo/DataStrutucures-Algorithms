# Sorting
Sorting is one of the fundamental problems of Computer Science.

Here we will introduce some main concepts and characteristics of the sorting algorithms we are going to
study in this section.

## Incremental Algorithms
**Definition**: An incremental algorithm is given a sequence of input, 
and finds a sequence of solutions that build incrementally while adapting to the changes in the input. [2]

## In-Loco/ In-Place sorting
**Definition**: An In-Place sorting algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using **no auxiliary data structure**. [1]

However, a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. 

In this case, **at all times**, 
a space <mark>S(n) = O(1)</mark> (constant) is the superior limit for the space that can be used 
**for variables that are external to the input data structure**.
