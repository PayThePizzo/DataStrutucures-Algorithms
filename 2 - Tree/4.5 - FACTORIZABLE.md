# Problem with trees
This is a general recursive approach to resolve problems on binary trees
by using a predefined type of algorithm

## Factorizable
It is based on Divide et Impera. 

```python
factorizable(Node u)
    if (u == NULL): #Test if tree is empty
        # Direct Solution
    else:
        left_res = factorizable(u.left);
        right_res = factorizable(u.right);
        return recombine(left_res, right_res);
```

**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = <mark>O(n)</mark>
* Every node is iterated through then we have T(n) = O(n)
* If base case and recombine have T(n) = O(1)
