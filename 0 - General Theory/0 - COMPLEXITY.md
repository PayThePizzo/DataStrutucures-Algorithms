### Amortized analysis
It is a method of analyzing the costs associated with a data structure that averages the worst operations out over time. 

Often, a data structure has one particularly costly operation, but it doesn't get performed very often. That data structure shouldn't be labeled a costly structure just because that one operation, that is seldom performed, is costly.

So, amortized analysis is used to average out the costly operations in the worst case. The worst-case scenario for a data structure is the absolute worst ordering of operations from a cost perspective. Once that ordering is found, then the operations can be averaged.

There are three main types of amortized analysis: aggregate analysis, the accounting method, and the potential method.
